This is the first release of (parts of) the JAdVA PHP components library. In
this release you'll find the database installer, with some general graph
classes (on which the database installer depends), as well as helper for storing
FAQs as XML, and a general system of file helper classes.

To install, simply copy the contents of the library directory into your PHP
include path.

For usage, see the documentation for the Jadva_Installer_Database_Abstract
class. ATM, only the MySQLi version is supported as database installer, but
the framework for other DBMSs is in place.
