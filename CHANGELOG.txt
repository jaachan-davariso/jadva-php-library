This is the changelog for the JAdVA PHP components library:

0.2.5
 Fixes:
  - Removed the checks on the FusionCharts allowed attributes since keeping 
    track of them is A) a lot of work, B) very complicated and C) not very
    useful.

0.2.4
 New features:
  - Added a Zend-style View Helper to render FusionCharts charts.
  - Greatly enhanced the functionality in the FusionCharts chart class. It can
    now deal with multiseries charts, funnel charts, trend lines, automatic
    colouring, category attributes and data set attributes.

0.2.3
 New features:
  - Added a file filter that filters based on regular expressions on the base
    name.
  - Added functions to quickly get a file or subdirectory from a directory.
  - Introduced various exceptions for file operations.
  - Allowed the setting of the database port and socket for the database 
    installer.
 Changes:
  - The Jadva_File subpackage now uses internally a file:// scheme, this to 
    allow testing with the vfs:// scheme as well. Note that the getPath() 
    function will return the path localised for the file scheme, i.e. it will
    return "C:\Windows\" on a Windows machine, as it did before.
  - Changed the FileSize filter to make the maximum inclusive. 
 Fixes:
  - Fixed a bug where the Jadva_File_Abstract constants where faulty numbered.
  - Fixed a bug where files without an extension were filtered out when denying
    files with a given extension.
  - Fixed a bug where the Jadva_File::getSize() function returned cached values.
  - Fixed a uncertainty to what would happen when copying or moving files; now 
    assuring that the target will be overwritten.

0.2.2
 Changes:
  - Automatically fixed the installer table for the 0.2.0 name change.
  - Moved the content check all the way to the beginning so we don't connect to
    MySQL and create a restore point when we have obviously faulty files.
  - Added a decent 'Done' message in the DB installer.
 Fixes:
  - Fixed a bug where, when mysql wouldn't run successfully, the installer would
    give the wrong error message.
  - Fixed a bug where the MySQLi DB Installer wouldn't be able to connect to
    different hosts.
  - Fixed a bug where the MySQLi DB Installer couldn't cope with white space so
    well.
  - Added a better error when the query files make a cyclic graph.

0.2.1
 - Fixed a bug where the MySQLi installer would not execute queries that weren't
   ended by a delimeter
 - Added copy, move & remove functions to files and directories.

0.2.0
 ! The table name for the database installer is now all lowercase
 - Added functionality for managing files

0.1.1
 - Fixed a bug where the installer would crash if MySQL threw a warning
 - When a query has failed, the query is now outputted in <pre>-format for
    better readability
0.1.0
 - Initial release
