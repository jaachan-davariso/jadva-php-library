This is the changelog for the JAdVA PHP components library:

0.2.2
 Changes:
  - Automatically fixed the installer table for the 0.2.0 name change.
  - Moved the content check all the way to the beginning so we don't connect to
    MySQL and create a restore point when we have obviously faulty files.
  - Added a decent 'Done' message in the DB installer.
 Fixes:
  - Fixed a bug where, when mysql wouldn't run successfully, the installer would
    give the wrong error message.
  - Fixed a bug where the MySQLi DB Installer wouldn't be able to connect to
    different hosts.

    well.
  - Added a better error when the query files make a cyclic graph.
